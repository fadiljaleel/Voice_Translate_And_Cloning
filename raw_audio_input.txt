My only aim was to keep my parents happy and earn a lot of money.
And it happened.
People have a myth that engineers don't earn money.
They earn.
I started teaching tuition.
I used to teach tuition to 11th and 12th students.
After that when I was in college.
Before college, when I passed 12th, when my boards got over.
So what do children generally do?
When boards get over, they go on vacations with their family.
They chill, sleep.
I did my first job in a call center.
From where I got to learn a lot.
How to talk to people.
After that when I was in college.
I worked in a CNG company part-time.
I worked there.
Along with that I was teaching tuition.
And while I was finishing college.
I put two cars in an Uber.
Because I needed money.
And I also opened a garage after finishing college.
That means I had the grace of Lakshmi ji.
I was getting good money.
Everything was sorted.
My family was very happy.
I was also very happy.
But there was something missing in my life.
Which I couldn't understand.
Now how will we know that there is something missing in our life?
When you feel that everything is very smooth.
There is no adventure in life.
And it is getting a little boring.
Then understand that you are in your comfort zone.
And when you are in your comfort zone.
Then you are productive.
But somewhere your growth stops.
And whenever you feel that you have gone to your comfort zone.
Then brother pick up your board like this.
And run away.
And I did the same.
At that time wine culture was new in India.
At that time people were not making it professionally.
I mean creators were making videos of 6 seconds.
And they were making people laugh.
Which I was very happy to see.
That in 6 seconds how this person is making someone laugh.
I used to feel very good.
